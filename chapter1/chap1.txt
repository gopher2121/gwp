web application : 
html to the client using http 


Http:stateless , text based , req resp protocol that uses client server computing model

subsequent requests has no clue of the former
plain text so that you don't need protocol analyser 
clien is the user agent 


http0.9 1990 http1.0 1996 http1.1 1999  http2.0

request line
request headers
blank line
message body(optional)

get - i need the resource
head - i need the resource with the response headers , however I fucking don't care of the message body , please don't carry the weight of the message body over the network
post - pass the data to the resource identified by the URI
put - that should be the resource at the location identified by the URI. if alreadyExist, replace it , else create a new resource
delete- delete the requested resource
options- tell me what are the methods do you support
trace- send me the request , so that i can know what the server did to the request 
connect- ssl https tunneling
patch - modifies the resouce 

get/head/options/trace are the safe methods as it doesn't change the 
state of the server

idempotent request  methods: 
a method is called idempotent if the state of the server doesn't 
change the second time with the same data

post is neither safe nor idempotent

html only supports get and post ... 
so how does you use other http methods

through browser apis called XMLHttpRequest
